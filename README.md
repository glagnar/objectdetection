This is repository will provide a framework for using OpenCV with an Edge TPU such as [Coral.ai](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator) for use both in develpment and deployment. It has been made in such a way, that you can develope and test with ease on your local machine - and use Docker to deploy on your hardware like for example the Raspbery Pi.

## Drone Support
 This framework is specifically tuned to work in a microservice environment, providing new capabilities to Drones using the [ROS](https://robots.ros.org) ecosystem. 

## Hardware / Software
This framework has been tested to run on the
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Rev 1.3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/)
* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
* [Macbook Pro 2018](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)

Running these different OS's
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Raspbian 2020-02-13 armhf
* Raspbian 2020-02-13 aarch64
* macOS Catalina 10.15.04

Using various cameras
* [PLAYSTATION Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye)
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/)
* Facetime Camera
* Lenovo Thinkvision Camera X1

## Premise
The idea is to provide tools for you to develop your own applications, using these examples to get you going - faster. There are some very good guides, how-to's and tutorials that you can use if you want to read more.

* [Building Multi-Arch Images for Arm and x86 with Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-images/)

## Note on Raspberry Pi
To use the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) on the Rasbery Pi as a standard USB camera, you must first load the driver using the modprobe command
```bash
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
```
or add `bcm2835-v4l2` to `/etc/modules`. This will expose the camera as a video device on `/dev/video0`.

## Note on Docker
We have provided a set of multi-arch docker images as a baseline that provide the needed OpenCV and Numpy libraries. Feel free to use you own, but the process of esablishing baseline images is very involved. The images can be found here.
